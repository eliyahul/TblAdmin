<p>Chapter Six.</p>
<p>In the restaurant, Mr. Akimoto tells us that a food buffet is called a Viking in Japan. Maybe the Japanese think Vikings eat this way. Whatever, the food looks great. There is a long counter covered with different things to choose from. The plates and bowls are smaller than the ones in restaurants at home. I heap different kinds of noodles, sushi, tempura and various mystery foods onto a plate.</p>
<p>Melissa and Zach are at one end of my table. As I walk by, I notice that Zach is trying just about everything, while Melissa only has a few small things on her plate.</p>
<p>I sit down and prepare to dig in. The waitress has given us forks as well as chopsticks. I pick up the chopsticks and start with some sushi.</p>
<p>A man sitting nearby picks up his bowl with one hand and uses chopsticks to scoop up long noodles. The noodles stretch between his mouth and the bowl. I can hear the slurp as he sucks up the noodles. This seems like a fun way to eat, so I try it with my own noodles.</p>
<p>“Gawd!\u201D.</p>
<p>I look up and see Melissa looking at me with disgust. How long has she been watching me? Staring right at her, I scoop up more noodles and suck them noisily into my mouth. She turns away with a huff. Zach laughs. He catches my eye for a second, nods his head in Melissa’s direction and rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>That was weird.</p>
<p>After we have finished eating, we wait outside for our host parents. The Stepwagon pulls up with Mrs. Seto at the wheel. I’m disappointed that Fumiko isn’t with her. Mrs. Seto tries to tell me something about Fumiko and Kenji. Since she doesn’t have much English and I have no Japanese, it takes most of the drive for me to figure out that they are at a place called a juku. It has something to do with school.</p>
<p>When we arrive at the house it’s starting to grow dark. Mr. Seto is kneeling on the front steps trimming the branches of a miniature tree in a pot. Several small potted trees are arranged up one side of the stairway. Mr. Seto stands up to greet us. We stop to admire the trees.</p>
<p>“Bonsai,\u201D Mr. Seto says, and I nod. I recognize the word.</p>
<p>“You make them small?\u201D I ask.</p>
<p>“Small, yes.\u201D He nods. I’m not sure if he’s agreeing they are small or if he’s saying that yes, he’s the one who prunes them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seto opens the front door and holds her hand out, indicating I should enter first. A sound catches my attention, and I hesitate.</p>
<p>Creak, creak.</p>
<p>It’s the same sound I heard when I arrived. It’s coming from the flooded rice paddy across the street.</p>
<p>“Kaeru,\u201D Mr. Seto says, noticing my curiosity.</p>
<p>“Frogs?\u201D I ask.</p>
<p>He nods and smiles.</p>
<p>“Kaeru. Frogs.\u201D.</p>
<p>I grin back. It’s a little thing, but it feels like a big breakthrough in communication.</p>
<p>“I want to take a look,\u201D I say, waving toward the other side of the street.</p>
<p>Mr. Seto’s smile disappears, and he says something in rapid Japanese. It goes straight over my head. So much for the breakthrough.</p>
<p>I gesture toward the rice paddy again and take a step in that direction.</p>
<p>Mr. Seto sets down his clippers and follows me.</p>
<p>“I’m just going across the street,\u201D I try to tell him. But it’s no good. I have an escort.</p>
<p>We walk the short distance in silence and stand at the edge of the field. It’s almost dark now, but there is still a tinge of pink in the sky. The croaks have stopped. We stand stiffly, waiting for them to start again. I scan the edge of the water and the rows of green plants but see no sign of frogs.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, we can go back,\u201D I say with a sigh, figuring Mr. Seto will understand.</p>
<p>“I guess going for a walk by myself is out of the question,\u201D I comment under my breath as we walk back to the house.</p>
<p>I hope Fumiko will be home soon. I feel out of place in the Setos’ house without her. I can’t talk with her parents, but they don’t want me to be on my own. I try watching television with them but can’t follow anything. I feel an overwhelming urge to speak to someone in English. I wonder what my family is doing right now. Of course it’s the middle of the night there. They are all still sleeping. Maybe I should e-mail them and let them know I’m still alive.</p>
<p>The Setos understand me when I say I’d like to use the computer—konpyuta, as Mr. Seto says. Mr. Seto sets me up in Fumiko’s room, switching her computer to English characters. I’m afraid he’s going to stay in the room with me, but he leaves after I thank him.</p>
<p>I type a quick note: The Setos are nice, the food is good, etc. It’s just the usual meaningless stuff that parents want to know. I’m just finishing when Fumiko and Kenji come home.</p>
<p>“Hi,\u201D Fumiko says when she finds me. “Did you have a good day?\u201D.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was pretty good,\u201D I tell her. “You were getting tutored?\u201D.</p>
<p>“Tutored?\u201D she asks. “Oh, you mean juku, cram school. I have much studying to do and get help there. So does Kenji. Do you have cram school in Canada?\u201D.</p>
<p>“Ah…\u201D I have to think. “Not exactly. Last year I had a chemistry tutor for a while…someone who helped me study.\u201D.</p>
<p>“You don’t have help now?\u201D she asks.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t really need it anymore,\u201D I say.</p>
<p>“You must be a very good student,\u201D Fumiko says wistfully.</p>
<p>“I’m not that great a student,\u201D I tell her, “but I do okay.\u201D.</p>
<p>“I see,\u201D she says, frowning. “In Japan, everyone who wants to go to university goes to juku. I am afraid I will not get into a good university if I do not study and do well on exams. Don’t you want to go to university?\u201D.</p>
<p>“I guess. I haven’t thought much about it yet. I’d like to study art, but maybe I’ll do computer graphics or something.\u201D.</p>
<p>“I want to be a translator,\u201D she says. “I want to translate English books into Japanese or work for a company with English clients.\u201D Her eyes meet mine for a moment with a look of intensity, and then they flick away. “But I don’t know if my English will be good enough.\u201D.</p>
<p>“It seems really good to me,\u201D I tell her. I’m surprised at how worried she is. I had pegged her for someone who avoided anything more serious than choosing which Hello Kitty barrette to wear.</p>
<p>Before bed, I have a hot bath again. It’s a routine I could get used to. In my room afterward, I pick up my sketchbook and flip to the manga character I’ve been working on. She stands legs apart, arms across her chest as if she is blocking out the world. But she’s daring it to come at her at the same time. I pick up my pencil and begin to sketch. She needs some kind of power, like a magic sword or a jewel pendant….</p>
<p>I start to sketch a sword hanging at her waist, but it doesn’t seem right. I try a dagger instead…Maybe it should be something more futuristic—some kind of gun…no, that’s not right, either….</p>
<p>I can’t just come up with a character on her own. I need to figure out what kind of world she lives in. I try to imagine where my character is, who her enemies are. But I can’t concentrate.</p>
<p>I toss the sketchbook onto the bed and sigh. Did Zach Bellows look at me like he was sharing a joke about Melissa tonight? Nah, that couldn’t be right…I walk over to the window. Across the street, the rice paddy is dark. I can hear the frogs croaking.</p>
<p>So far, Japan is not what I expected. I feel like I have seen so much but just touched the surface. There is still a whole hidden world out there.</p>
