<p>Chapter Eight.</p>
<p>As we approach the school, I find myself hoping Melissa and the others will see me. Me, being popular. But then I catch myself. How lame. I don’t care what Melissa and her so-called friends think. Unlike her, I don’t need a bunch of groupies hanging off me to feel good about myself.</p>
<p>A bus is already parked in front of the school, and Mr. Crawford and Ms. Delucci are standing in front of it.</p>
<p>Ms. Delucci waves me over. I say good- bye to Fumiko and the others.</p>
<p>“We’re getting an earlier start on our tour today,\u201D Ms. Delucci tells me. “If you can help me round up the others, I’d appreciate it.\u201D.</p>
<p>I look at her blankly. Me, round up the others? I don’t think so. Interpreting my look correctly, Ms. Delucci sighs.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll have to wait until the homeroom teachers announce it, then,\u201D she says.</p>
<p>“We could always leave without the others,\u201D I suggest.</p>
<p>“Right,\u201D she says sarcastically. Then we catch sight of DJ and a couple of other boys. “Though it is tempting,\u201D she adds.</p>
<p>When our group has assembled beside the bus, Mr. Crawford holds up his hands for our attention. Before he can say anything, DJ calls out.</p>
<p>“Are we going to the racetrack today?\u201D.</p>
<p>“No, Derek, we are not going to the racetrack,\u201D Mr. Crawford says with forced patience. “You can do those things on your own time. Today we are going to a Japanese historical site.\u201D.</p>
<p>There are a few groans.</p>
<p>“What kind of historical site?\u201D Zach asks from near the front.</p>
<p>“We’re going to visit an old town called Seki-cho,\u201D Mr. Crawford explains. “In the old days, Japan was ruled by the Shogun, the head of the samurai lords. He lived in Edo, which is now Tokyo. The emperor was only a figurehead then, and he lived in Kyoto. All the lords had to have homes in Edo as well as on their own land. They had to spend every second year in Edo, so the Shogun could keep control over them.\u201D.</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford is in socials-teacher mode. “So, there was always a lot of traffic flowing to and from Edo. The main route between Kyoto and Edo was called the Tokaido Road. There were stations or rest stops all along the route. Seki-cho was one of those stops. It hasn’t changed much in two hundred years.\u201D.</p>
<p>“That’s just great,\u201D Melissa grumbles. “I guess they don’t have Starbucks or McDonald’s, then.\u201D.</p>
<p>A few people snicker.</p>
<p>“And we have one more surprise,\u201D Mr. Crawford continues. “Mr. Akimoto can’t come with us today. He’s making arrangements for a special trip tomorrow.\u201D.</p>
<p>“Where? Where are we going?\u201D Several interested voices interrupt.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to tell you until we know for sure,\u201D Mr. Crawford says. “I’ve got a cell phone with me, and Mr. Akimoto will call as soon as all of the plans have been confirmed.\u201D.</p>
<p>He holds up his hand for attention as talk ripples through the group.</p>
<p>“Now, since Mr. Akimoto can’t be with us, the school has decided to let its two top English students join us.\u201D He pauses to let this sink in. “Some of you will know them: Fumiko Seto and Aki Nishikawa.\u201D.</p>
<p>I’m one of the first people on the bus this time. I find a seat near the front where Fumiko will see me. After about fifteen minutes, Fumiko and Aki show up. They climb on, and Ms. Delucci introduces them.</p>
<p>Fumiko looks pleased but shy as she smiles at all of us. She sees the empty seat beside me and gives me a grateful look when I gesture for her to join me. I feel weird to be actually saving a seat for someone.</p>
<p>“See,\u201D I whisper to Fumiko. “Even your school thinks you’re a good translator.\u201D.</p>
<p>Fumiko shakes her head and hides her smile behind one hand, but I can tell she is pumped.</p>
<p>The drive to Seki-cho takes about a half an hour. The bus lets us off in front of a temple.</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford gestures down the narrow street of wooden buildings. Many have curved roofs and wooden bars over the upper story windows.</p>
<p>“As I was telling you earlier,\u201D he says, “this street has hardly changed in over two hundred years. I’d like you to imagine for a minute what it would have looked like with the street full of samurais and ladies in kimonos…\u201D.</p>
<p>There’s silence for a second as if everyone really is trying to picture it. Then Melissa’s voice cuts through the quiet.</p>
<p>“Look, there’s a caf&#233;. It says in English right there on the sign.\u201D.</p>
<p>Everyone turns to see.</p>
<p>“I’m dying for a coffee,\u201D she announces, like we all care. “Please tell me they have normal coffee.\u201D.</p>
<p>She looks past Zach.</p>
<p>“Where’s that girl?…Fumiko, you have to help me,\u201D she pleads, catching sight of Fumiko beside me.</p>
<p>Mr. Crawford holds up a hand to get our attention again.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome to get a coffee if you like and explore the street on your own. But before you all take off, we need to go over a few things.\u201D He gives us a quick version of the you-are-ambassadors speech. Then he tells us to meet back at the temple in two hours.</p>
<p>Melissa pushes through the group and grabs Fumiko’s arm.</p>
<p>“Come on, Fumiko,\u201D she says, ignoring me.</p>
<p>Fumiko turns and apologizes before allowing Melissa to drag her away.</p>
<p>“I will help people order coffee,\u201D she says to me and anyone listening. “Then we can walk along the street and look at some points of interest.\u201D.</p>
<p>I watch Fumiko disappear into the caf&#233; with Melissa and the others. So that’s it. I’ve lost Fumiko. Was I thinking I was going to spend the day with her? Did I actually want to? Whatever. I’m not sticking around to hear Melissa dis me in front of her. There is a dull ache in the back of my chest, but I shove it aside. I’d rather be on my own anyway.</p>
<p>Maya and a few others are walking down the middle of the street just ahead of me. I stop and pretend interest in a shop window. In the window display a yellow ceramic cat sits with one paw raised as if beckoning people into the store. I hesitate for a second, take a deep breath, and then I push open the door and step inside.</p>
<p>The store is small and crowded with trinkets. An older woman wearing a faded pink apron over modern clothes stands behind the counter. She smiles and says something in Japanese. I smile back.</p>
<p>“I’m just looking,\u201D I say in English.</p>
<p>On one shelf there is a row of yellow cats, smaller versions of the one in the window. I pick one up and look at it. The cat has a red collar with a gold bell painted around its neck. On the bottom of the figure is a sticker that says five hundred. Five hundred yen is somewhere around five dollars.</p>
<p>“Maneki-neko,\u201D the shop woman says, coming out from behind the counter to hover beside me.</p>
<p>“Lucky cat,\u201D she adds in careful English.</p>
<p>I nod and smile. I’ve seen cats like this in Japanese restaurants back in Vancouver. This one looks handmade. Maybe my mom would like it for her office.</p>
<p>“I’ll get this one,\u201D I say, bringing the cat to the counter.</p>
<p>The woman ducks behind the counter. She wraps the cat in tissue paper before placing it in a plastic bag. She says something in Japanese and pushes a tray across the counter toward me. I place a thousand yen bill onto the tray. The woman smiles broadly and sets my change into the tray. I smile back. It’s like we’re talking with smiles.</p>
<p>“Arigato gozaimashita,\u201D the woman says as I turn to go.</p>
<p>“Arigato,\u201D I tell her.</p>
<p>Back on the street again, I’m in a better mood. This is the first time I’ve been in a Japanese store by myself, I realize. It went pretty well. I need to get away on my own more on this trip.</p>
<p>The rest of the morning I duck in and out of stores, trying to avoid Melissa. This also means keeping out of sight of Fumiko. But I’m sure Melissa and the rest of the group are keeping her busy. At one point I see them a block away talking and laughing. Before they notice me, I slip through a doorway into some kind of museum.</p>
<p>A woman greets me in Japanese. When I don’t understand, she hands me an English pamphlet that says the building used to be an inn. I pay the entrance fee and walk through a dirt passageway. The pamphlet explains what all the rooms used to be. This passage was the kitchen. There is a room at the front of the inn with a raised wooden floor where the inn’s guests were greeted.</p>
<p>On the top floor is a sleeping room with old-fashioned futons on the floor. There are wooden headrests that look like pedestals with little flat pillows on top. I can’t imagine how anyone could sleep on them. The inn has three separate sleeping rooms. The floor of each room is slightly higher than the last. Apparently, the more important the guests were, the higher their sleeping level. At the front of the inn, the windows that overlook the road have angled wooden bars in front of them. The pamphlet explains that the bars allowed people to look at the street below without being seen. Ordinary people were not supposed to look directly at higher class people. But if everyone knew what the bars were for, it would be no secret that they were being looked at, it seems to me.</p>
<p>Still, I like the idea of being able to spy on people down below. I look out through the bars to test it out.</p>
<p>I realize it is time to meet at the temple. I won’t be able to avoid the others anymore. As I walk back up the street, I fix my face into a non-caring mask.</p>
